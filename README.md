# **BlockSafe: Decentralized Data Framework (DDF)**  
 
BlockSafe is a **Decentralized Data Framework** designed to securely store, share, and manage sensitive data using blockchain technology. It serves as a flexible and scalable solution for building decentralized applications (dApps) across various industries, such as healthcare, voting, and certificate verification.  

Our first application built on **BlockSafe** is a **Medical Record System**, ensuring the privacy, security, and accessibility of medical data for patients, hospitals, and insurance providers.

## **How BlockSafe Works**

1. **Data Submission**: Sensitive data (e.g., medical records) is encrypted and stored off-chain using **IPFS/Filecoin**.
2. **Blockchain Logging**: The hash of the stored data is logged on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and transparency.
3. **Access Control**: Patients (data owners) use their wallets to grant/revoke access to specific entities like hospitals or insurers.
4. **Transparency**: All access requests and transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## **Medical Record System (Use Case)**

### **Overview**
The **Medical Record System** is a dApp built using BlockSafe to securely store and share medical data.  
- Patients control their records using their wallets.  
- Hospitals upload records, which are stored in IPFS.  
- Access permissions are logged and managed on the blockchain.
